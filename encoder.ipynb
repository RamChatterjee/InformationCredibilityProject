Well, if you purchased an iPhone and find that you need to open the SIM tray, you can either try to bend a paperclip and try to get it in straight, or you can order this tool.  Personally, I found this tool to work much better!I was a bit surprised to find that three tools were included in the shipment instead of the one described.  So, I am more than pleased with this order.  The tool works great and because of the shape, it goes in straight and opens the tray with ease.Having three of them makes it less likely to lose the tool.  This way I can keep one at home with the paperwork, take one on trips overseas (cheaper to buy prepaid chips at the airports) and have one more put away.The tool arrived on time and it works great!!  I would highly recommend the tool and the vendor.\",\n          \"This case is mega study. I bought this because I go kayaking with my dad.The case is big enough to fit my IPhone and IPod in their perfectly (with their protective cases), without them moving around in there.Length wise, for just storing those 2 items it's a bit big, but at the same time its not big enough for me to squeeze my wallet in there as well.Size wise, I would have preferred a little smaller to perfectly fit the phones, or a bit longer to fit something else in there as well.That's my fault though. You can read about the sizes but I never seem to picture it right until I have the product sitting right in front of me.But it gets the job done.

Well, if you purchased an iPhone and find that you need to open the SIM tray, you can either try to bend a paperclip and try to get it in straight, or you can order this tool.  Personally, I found this tool to work much better!I was a bit surprised to find that three tools were included in the shipment instead of the one described.  So, I am more than pleased with this order.  The tool works great and because of the shape, it goes in straight and opens the tray with ease.Having three of them makes it less likely to lose the tool.  This way I can keep one at home with the paperwork, take one on trips overseas (cheaper to buy prepaid chips at the airports) and have one more put away.The tool arrived on time and it works great!!  I would highly recommend the tool and the vendor.\",\n          \"This case is mega study.

You can read about the sizes but I never seem to picture it right until I have the product sitting right in front of me.But it gets the job done.

Well, if you purchased an iPhone and find that you need to open the SIM tray, you can either try to bend a paperclip and try to get it in straight, or you can order this tool.  Personally, I found this tool to work much better!I was a bit surprised to find that three tools were included in the shipment instead of the one described.  So, I am more than pleased with this order.  The tool works great and because of the shape, it goes in straight and opens the tray with ease.Having three of them makes it less likely to lose the tool.  This way I can keep one at home with the paperwork, take one on trips overseas (cheaper to buy prepaid chips at the airports) and have one more put away.The tool arrived on time and it works great!!  I would highly recommend the tool and the vendor.\",\n          \"This case is mega study.

You can read about the sizes but I never seem to picture it right until I have the product sitting right in front of me.But it gets the job done.
